First endeavor into full stack development.

The goal of this project was to start getting my hands on DB design, backend development, and API design, by creating a simple website that renders objects to an HTML canvas element based on the data in the database. The simplicity of the app was used to focus time on learning how create and manage a database, handle serving files from the backend to the frontend, and creating API endpoints for creating a new table entry, grabbing all table entries, and grabbing a specific table entry.

As this project is very small scale, it doesn't feel worth hosting. That said, it will not be a live site. It is purely for experimentation and exploration into full stack.

### The Stack
Frontend - Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS for simplicity
Backend - Node/Express.js
Database - MySQL
